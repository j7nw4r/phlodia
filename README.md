# phlodia

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phloeodes_diabolicus - is a type of ironclad beetle. Iron -> Rust, Beetle -> (Franz) Kafka. It's the closest I can think of.


The goal of pholdia is to be a Kubernetes native simple Kafka distrobution, written in Rust. It can be deployed as just a single broker, or can be organized into a multi broker grouping using a Phlodia Operator. The backing storage of the brokers are s3 compatible storage.
